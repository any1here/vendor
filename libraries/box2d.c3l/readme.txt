This library follows the same licence as the rest of the vendor libraries, if any.
 
My main language is not English, so expect grammer erros in code comments...
I'm also not a expert on C3 language and this, is my first vendor library, I did it initially for my own use but I think it can benefit others in the C3 community. 
I most also warn that some things maybe wrong, as I'm not a box2d pro or can be done in a better way, specially as c3 language evolves and gets new features, in any case, be free to solve any issues, if you encounter them.
Hope this is useful to others.
